## Tyrone Williams


My journey has taken me through university and the military but up until recently i was quite intimated by programming, then i joined @makersacademy, conquered my fear and learned another skill to cover that technical weakness.

What excites me about technology is also what makes it scary - it is everywhere and it is challenging our place in society. In manufacturing, logistics and retail automation and robotics have made workers obsolete and now AI is encroaching into the creative, academic and managerial roles, beating us at our own game (quite literally in the case of Alphazero and Alphastar).

I understand which steps I need to take to complete that task in an efficient, independent, and timely manner.
